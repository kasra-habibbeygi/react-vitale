# Custom Hook - useTimer

You can use this hook to create a timer that provides you with the values for days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

## Usage
First, import the hook using named import:

```jsx
import { useTimer } from 'react-vitale/hooks';

const { days, hours, minutes, seconds, setNewCountDown } = useTimer(0);
```

As input, you can provide a number which is a timestamp.

**Timestamp Format :**
Suppose you want to set your timer to 2 days ahead. To do this, you need to subtract the current timestamp from 2 days in the future and pass it to the custom hook.

**What Is setNewCountDown**
You can use this to set the time instead of directly passing the timestamp to the hook at the time of mount.

**Example :**

```jsx
import { useTimer } from 'react-vitale/hooks';


const Timer = () => {
    let twoDaysLater = new Date();
    twoDaysLater.setDate(today.getDate() + 2);

    const { days, hours, minutes, seconds } = useTimer(twoDaysLater.getTime());

    return (
        <div>
            <span>{days} : </span>
            <span>{hours} : </span>
            <span>{minutes} : </span>
            <span>{seconds} : </span>
        </div>
    )
}
```
