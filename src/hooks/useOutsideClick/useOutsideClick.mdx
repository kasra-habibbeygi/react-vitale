# useOutsideClick Hook

You can use this hook when you want something to happen when you click outside of a specified element.

For example, suppose you want to create a `DropDown`. You need to close the menu when user click out side the menu.



## Usage

First, import the hook using named import:

```js
import { useOutsideClick } from 'react-vitale/hooks';
```

This custom hook returns three things: state, setState and ref. It does not take any inputs.

**Note :** You can name the returned values anything you want and use them accordingly.

**Description of state :**
Returns true or false and can be used to manage the open/close state of an element or for any other purpose.

**Description of setState :**
Can be used to set the value of state.

**Description of ref :**
Used to reference an element so that the custom hook knows where the outside click occurs.

### **Example**
Suppose I want to create a bell icon that when clicked, displays a dropdown containing notifications. The dropdown should close when you click outside of it or when you click the bell icon again.

```js
import { useOutsideClick } from 'react-vitale/hooks';

const Notification = () => {
    const [notifDropDownState, setNotifDropDownState, notifRef] = useOutsideClick();

    return (
        <div ref={notifRef}>
            <Bell onClick={() => setNotifDropDownState(!notifDropDownState)} />
            <div className={`${notifDropDownState ? 'active' : ''}`}>
                <div>
                    <p>Your Identity Verification is Approved</p>
                    <small>
                        Congratulations
                    </small>
                </div>
                <Link href='/' className='see_more'>
                    View More <Angle />
                </Link>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```
