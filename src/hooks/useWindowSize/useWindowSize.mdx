## useWindowSize Hook

This hook is used to get the width and height of the user's browser window and detect the smallest changes in its size.

**Note:** Keep in mind that because this hook updates with the slightest change in the browser's size, it is natural to have many re-renders, especially when the user resizes their browser window.

To use this hook, you can import it as follows:

```js
import { useWindowSize } from 'react-vitale/hooks';

const [width, height] = useWindowSize();
