# useOnScreen Hook

This custom hook returns a boolean value that indicates whether an element is in view on the page or not.

## Usage

**Note :** The hook does not cause frequent re-renders, thereby maintaining good performance for your application.

First, import the hook using named import:


```js
import { useOutsideClick } from 'react-vitale/hooks';
```

This hook requires a ref as input from you, which points to the element you want to know whether it is present on the page or not.

```js
import { useRef, useState } from 'react';
import { useOutsideClick } from 'react-vitale/hooks';

const Test = () => {
    const ref = useRef(null);
    const isVisible = useOnScreen(ref);

    return (
        <p ref={ref}>ref</p>
    )
}
```
