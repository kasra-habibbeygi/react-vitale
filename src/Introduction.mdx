# Introduction

Welcome to **Adak Pro** Storybook! As a leading entity in the programming and IT sector, we have developed this Storybook to streamline the development process for our team and provide easy access to our custom components. Our goal is to enhance efficiency and speed up the workflow for developers, both now and in the future.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this Storybook is to facilitate developers by offering a comprehensive collection of our company's custom components. By providing a centralized resource, we aim to improve accessibility and promote consistency across projects.

## Covered Topics

In this Storybook, you will find a wide array of front-end components that have been meticulously designed and developed using React, Emotion, and MUI. Our components are built to be as complete as possible, ensuring that they meet the diverse needs of our development team.

We hope this Storybook serves as a valuable resource, helping you to work more efficiently and effectively. Happy coding!

## Why MUI and Emotion?

You might wonder why we used MUI and Emotion in this Storybook instead of CSS modules. Before I started developing this Storybook, I did extensive research on this matter. There is no issue in using multiple third-party libraries in our library.

Just like many component libraries available in the market today :)

The reason I used MUI in some places is that the components it offers (some of them) are very clean and have beautiful animations. If I were to develop those without using MUI, it would take a lot of time, and we don't have that luxury.

Again, I emphasize that there is absolutely nothing wrong with using third-party libraries in our own libraries.

**We don't need to reinvent the wheel** (as long as it doesn't impact performance, of course).
